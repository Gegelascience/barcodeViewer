This repository is a recap to compare different languages.
To do so, only standard lib is allowed (special case for UI rendering).
Features that you be implemented (minus possibilities) are:

- render EAN in png file (binary file)
- render EAN on UI (possible to add UI library if no UI exist in standard lib)
- implement unit test
